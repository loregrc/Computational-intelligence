# Computational-Intelligence_2023/2024
Hi, I'm Lorenzo Greco (s306112) and this is my works from the Computational intelligence course at POLITO!

# Content Overview
1. Lab 1:
    - A* algorithm
2. Lab 2:
    - Evolutionary algorithm for Nim game
3. Lab 3:
    - Local-search algorithm (eg. an EA) able to solve the *Problem* instances 1, 2, 5, and 10 on a 1000-loci genomes, using a minimum number of fitness calls

# Note
For solving the labs, I collaborated with:

- Luca Barbato s320213
- Giuseppe Roberto Allegra s305063

That being said, I am fully responsible and aware of all the code uploaded to the repository.
