# Computational-Intelligence_2023/2024
Hi, I'm Lorenzo Greco (s306112) and this is my works from the Computational intelligence course at POLITO!

# Content Overview
1. Lab 1:
    - A* algorithm
2. Lab 2:
    - Evolutionary algorithm for Nim game
3. Lab 3:
    - Local-search algorithm (eg. an EA) able to solve the *Problem* instances 1, 2, 5, and 10 on a 1000-loci genomes, using a minimum number of fitness calls
4. Lab 4:
    - Use reinforcement learning to devise a tic-tac-toe player
5. Peer-reviews:
    - All my peer-reviews from Lab2, Lab3, Lab4
6. Quixo:
    - This project implements an artificial intelligence based on the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to play Quixo
7. Report:
    - My report for this course

# Note
For solving the labs, I collaborated with:

- Luca Barbato s320213
- Giuseppe Roberto Allegra s305063

That being said, I am fully responsible and aware of all the code uploaded to the repository.
